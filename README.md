### Additional Notes:
- **1D DP**: Problems that can be solved using a single-dimensional array for storing states.
- **2D DP**: Problems requiring a two-dimensional array for storing states (usually involving two input sequences).
- **Backtracking with DP**: Problems that utilize a backtracking approach while caching results to avoid recalculating.
- **Combination DP**: Problems that involve selecting items with constraints, often related to knapsack or coin change problems.
- **Advanced DP**: More complex problems that may combine different techniques or require a deeper understanding of DP principles.
